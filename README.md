# Release numbering rules

# Architecture
MVC – short for Model-View-Controller – is Apple’s preferred way of architecting apps for its platforms, and so it’s the default approach used by most developers on Apple platforms. Many iOS frameworks, like UIKit, use the MVC pattern to structure data flow and messaging.Here , i have also used MVC structure in this AudioRecorder App.

In MVC each piece of  code is one of three things:
Models store  data, such as the names of products in a store.
Views render data for users, for example a table showing the list of products available.
Controllers combine the two, by querying the model and converting its data to something views can show.

One of my jobs as an app developer is to keep my apps maintainable. This means that I should document my code, keep my code concise and readable, and adhere to a supporting structure.

Model-View-Controller is that structure. It keeps my code from becoming one big pile of chaos. That’s the first and foremost benefit of using Model-View-Controller. I get more deliberate at designing the flow of data.
